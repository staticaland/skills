# create-pr

Open a PR whose description lets a reviewer judge the change without having
been in the session.

## Steps

1. Run `<skill-dir>/scripts/pr.py prepare`, where `<skill-dir>` is this
   skill's base directory. It pushes the branch, prints the template to fill,
   and prints the `BODY FILE:` path it created for this run.
2. Fill every template section from the whole session, not the diff alone: the
   original request, the decisions made and their tradeoffs, and what was
   tested and how. Follow the writing instructions in the template's comments,
   and leave the comments in place - the submit step removes them.
3. Read the `BODY FILE:` path `prepare` printed with the Read tool - the file
   is an empty placeholder, and the Write tool refuses a file it has not read.
   Then write the filled template to that exact path - never a path of your
   own choosing, which risks reusing a stale body from an earlier session.
   Then run:

   ```bash
   <skill-dir>/scripts/pr.py submit "<title>" <body-file>
   ```

The submit command strips the comments and creates the PR through `gh`; the
guard hook blocks a bare `gh pr create`.
