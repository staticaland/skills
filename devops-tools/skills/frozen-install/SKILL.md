description: "Replace resolving install commands with frozen ones — `npm ci`, `uv sync --locked` — at every site meant to reproduce a lockfile: CI workflows, image builds, task runners, deploy scripts, and docs. Use when the user wants reproducible installs, or mentions `npm install` in CI, `npm ci`, clean-install, `--frozen-lockfile`, or lockfile drift. Covers `npm` and `uv`."

# Frozen Install

An install command either **resolves** — reads the ranges in the manifest, picks versions, and writes the lockfile — or is **frozen**: it installs the lockfile exactly and fails when it cannot. `npm install` resolves even with a lockfile sitting beside it. `npm ci` is frozen.

Sort every install site by intent. A site that reproduces an environment — CI, an image build, a deploy, a contributor's first setup — belongs on the frozen side. A site that moves the lockfile forward is a **resolving site**, and a person running it deliberately is the point of it.

The fix is a pair, not a flag: a frozen command needs a committed lockfile, and a committed lockfile needs a frozen command. Either half alone gives a broken build or silent drift.

**Loud is the point.** A frozen install that fails because the lockfile disagrees with the manifest has done its job. Regenerate the lockfile and commit it; unfreezing the command deletes the only check that the two ever agree.

Read the flags off the installed tool, not from memory: `npm help ci`, `uv sync --help`.

## Procedure

### 1. Inventory the install sites

```bash
git grep -nE '\b(npm (i|install|add|ci|clean-install|update)|uv (sync|add|run|export|lock|pip [a-z]+))\b'
```

The hits land in more kinds of file than CI: `Dockerfile` and `Containerfile`, `Makefile`, `justfile`, `Taskfile.yml`, `mise.toml` tasks, shell scripts, `package.json` scripts such as `postinstall` and `prepare`, `devcontainer.json`, platform config such as `netlify.toml`, `vercel.json`, and `Procfile`, and the code blocks in `README.md` and the docs.

Give each hit a row: file and line, the command, the kind of site, and a reproducing-or-resolving verdict.

Done when every hit has a row with a verdict, docs and image builds included, and each row names the lockfile it depends on.

### 2. Check the lockfile

Settle this per manager before touching any command:

```bash
git ls-files package-lock.json uv.lock           # committed?
git check-ignore -v package-lock.json uv.lock    # ignored anywhere?
uv lock --check                                  # current with pyproject.toml?
npm install --package-lock-only && git diff --exit-code package-lock.json
```

A missing or stale lockfile turns step 3 into a build failure. Regenerate and commit it first, in its own commit, so the rewrite lands on a green build. Read `.dockerignore` too: a lockfile that never reaches the build context is the same problem one layer down.

Done when each manager has a committed lockfile its own tool reports as current, or a recorded plan to commit one first.

### 3. Rewrite the reproducing sites

| Resolving | Frozen | Fails when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm install`, `npm i`, `npm add` | `npm ci` | `package-lock.json` is missing, or disagrees with `package.json` |
| `npm install --no-save` | `npm ci` | as above — `--no-save` protects the file, not the versions |
| `npm install --production` | `npm ci --omit=dev` | as above |
| `uv sync` | `uv sync --locked` | `uv.lock` is missing or out of date with `pyproject.toml` |
| `uv run <cmd>` | `uv run --locked <cmd>` | as above |
| `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` | `uv pip sync --require-hashes requirements.txt` | a requirement carries no matching hash |
| `npm update`, `uv add`, `uv lock --upgrade` | keep — this is a resolving site | — |

`npm ci` deletes `node_modules` before installing, so it costs a full install. That cost is what makes it reproducible.

uv gives two words and they differ. `--locked` asserts the lockfile is current and errors if resolution would change it; `--frozen` skips that check and installs what the lockfile already says. Use `--locked` wherever the manifest is present, which is nearly everywhere. Reach for `--frozen` only where the layer cannot support the check — a Docker build that copies `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` without the project source — and put a `uv lock --check` step in CI to cover what it skips. `UV_LOCKED=1` freezes every uv command in a job at once; `npm` carries it on each command.

For a manager this table omits, get its word from `<tool> install --help`. The vocabulary is `--frozen-lockfile` (`pnpm`, Yarn 1, `bun`), `--immutable` (Yarn 2+), `--locked` (Cargo), `--deployment` (Bundler), `--enforce-lockfile` (`dart pub`), `--locked-mode` (`dotnet restore`), and `-lockfile=readonly` (Terraform).

Done when every reproducing row runs a frozen command, and every resolving row carries a comment naming it as one.

### 4. Close the ways back in

A frozen step still drifts when something downstream resolves:

- a later `npm install <pkg>`, `uv add`, or `uv pip install` in the same job
- a `package.json` script the frozen step triggers — `postinstall`, `prepare` — running its own install
- a `Makefile` target CI calls: the workflow step reads as frozen, the target inside it is not
- a `Dockerfile` that copies the source before the lockfile, or a `.dockerignore` that keeps the lockfile out of the build context

Done when nothing after a frozen install writes a lockfile or installs a package, and the lockfile reaches every image build.

### 5. Make the drift loud once

Prove the check fires instead of trusting the flag. Widen a dependency range in `package.json` or `pyproject.toml`, leave the lockfile alone, run the rewritten command, and confirm it exits non-zero. Then revert and confirm it exits zero.

```bash
npm ci; echo $?
uv sync --locked; echo $?
```

Done when each rewritten command has been observed failing on a manufactured mismatch and passing on the committed state, or carries a stated reason it could not run here.

Report the rewritten sites, the resolving sites left deliberate, and the one named way the lockfile now moves forward — a person running `npm update` or `uv lock --upgrade`, or an update bot's pull requests. Pair a bot with the `dependency-cooldown` skill so the versions it resolves have aged first.
