# Parallel Steps

GitHub Actions runs the steps of a job in sequence. The `background` keywords change this. The model is the shell: `background: true` is `&`, and `wait` is `wait`.

This document obeys ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Write all prose that you add to it in the same style.

## Procedure

### 1. Map the dependencies

Read the workflow file. For each step, find the steps that must complete before it. A step depends on a different step when it reads that step's files, outputs, or services. Done when each step has a list of the steps it depends on. An empty list is permitted.

### 2. Apply the keywords

Change the steps by their role:

- **Independent group.** Put steps with no dependencies between them in one `parallel` block.
- **Service.** A server, a database, or an emulator: give the step an `id` and set `background: true`. Add a `cancel: <id>` step after the last step that uses the service.
- **Side task.** A step that no different step reads, such as a telemetry upload: set `background: true`. Do not add `wait`.
- **Reader.** A step that reads the result of a background step: add a `wait: <id>` step before it. To wait for all the background steps that came before, use `wait-all` in place of `wait`.

Done when each background step has a `wait` or `cancel` reference. A side task with no reader needs neither.

### 3. Verify the workflow

Run `actionlint` on the file if the tool is installed. `actionlint` does not support these keywords yet ([rhysd/actionlint#693](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/issues/693)), so it can report an error or a warning on a `background`, `wait`, `wait-all`, `cancel`, or `parallel` step that agrees with the reference. Ignore those messages. Read the changed workflow again. Make sure that no step reads data from a background step without a `wait` between them. Report the steps that stay in sequence and the reason for each.

## Keywords

| Keyword            | Effect                                                                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `background: true` | Starts the step and continues to the next step immediately.                       |
| `wait: <id>`       | Stops until the named background steps complete. Accepts one id or a list of ids. |
| `wait-all:`        | Stops until all the background steps before this point complete.                  |
| `cancel: <id>`     | Stops the named background step without an error.                                 |
| `parallel:`        | Runs a group of steps as background steps, then waits for all of them.            |

## Example: service

```yaml
steps:
 - name: Start test server
    id: server
    run: npm run start
    background: true
 - name: Run E2E tests
    run: npm run e2e
 - name: Stop server
    cancel: server
```

## Example: independent group

```yaml
steps:
 - parallel:
     - name: Build the app
        run: npm run build
     - name: Build the docs
        run: npm run docs
 - name: Package
    run: npm run package
```

The [workflow syntax reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax) is the source of truth for these keywords. If a keyword does not agree with this document, obey the reference.
